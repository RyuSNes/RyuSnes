This is a simple and easy to use leisure game.

The rule of the game is to click two or more adjacent color blocks with your fingers. The more color blocks you remove at one time, the higher the score. Each level has specified scoring requirements. The more you score, the more levels you can pass.

In addition, there are three kinds of reward props in the game, which will be obtained after each customs clearance (can also be obtained through incentive video). Use them effectively!
